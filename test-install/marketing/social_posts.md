**Professional Post:**
After years in cybersecurity, I noticed a gap: expensive, fragmented training tools that don't reflect real-world needs.

So I built Project Omega - an open-source platform that delivers:
• Complete defensive lifecycle (Monitor → Deceive → Respond)
• Beginner-friendly tutorials (Phase 2G: 15-minute start)
• Safe sandbox for risk-free learning
• Enterprise tools made accessible

Perfect for:
• Cybersecurity students
• IT professionals transitioning to security
• Junior SOC analysts
• Academic institutions

Try the beginner tutorial and let me know what you think!

**r/cybersecurity Post:**
**Title:** Showcasing Project Omega: Free, open-source security training platform

**Body:**
Hi r/cybersecurity,

I've been working on Project Omega for several months and wanted to share it with this community.

**The Problem:** Security training is either expensive ($10k+ platforms), fragmented (different tools for monitoring/deception/response), or unsafe for beginners.

**The Solution:** Project Omega - an all-in-one, open-source platform that's:
• Free (MIT licensed)
• Beginner-friendly (15-min tutorial to get started)
• Complete (Monitor → Deceive → Respond lifecycle)
• Safe (Sandbox mode protects your systems)

**Phase 2G - Beginner Tutorial:**
Try it with: python3 omega_v4_phase_2g_final.py
Select "Beginner Mode" for the 15-minute experience.

**Looking for:**
• Feedback from security professionals
• Beta testers for advanced features
• Contributors for the open-source project
